1. HTTP/1.1 200 OK, the http request was succeeded and the server successfully returned the requested page headers.

2. Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) this header reveals the web server software and version used by the host.
It is specific, not generic, because it gives: The software name: Apache, The version: 2.4.7, The operating system: Ubuntu

1. Go ahead and ScanMe!
2. <form class="nst-search" id="nst-head-search" action="/search/">
    <input class="nst-search-q" name="q" type="search" placeholder="Site Search">
    <button class="nst-search-button" title="Search">
     <img style="width:100%;aspect-ratio:1/1;" alt="" aria-hidden="true"
      src="/shared/images/nst-icons.svg#search">
     </button>
   </form>

    This is a search form part of a website’s header. It lets users type a search query and submit it to the server.

1. Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
→ Yes. Both reported HTTP 200 OK and the Server header "Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)".

If different, what header or other factor might explain it?
→ In general, differences could happen because:
   - requests follows redirects automatically, while curl -I does not unless -L is used;
   - requests sends a GET request, while curl -I sends a HEAD request;
   - User-Agent strings differ (servers may serve different pages depending on client);

1. Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
→ No, the status (200 OK) and server header (gunicorn/19.9.0) were identical. 
   The only difference was the Content-Length, which changed slightly because 
   the JSON body contained a different User-Agent string.

2. If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
→ Changes in status or response could indicate that the server or a web 
   application firewall inspects the User-Agent header. Some servers block or 
   modify responses for known scanning tools or bots as a form of defense, 
   to reduce automated probing or scraping activity.
   



The most useful reconnaissance details were: 
(1) the HTTP status line, which shows whether a host is reachable and what protocol version it uses.
(2) the Server header, which reveals software and version information valuable for vulnerability analysis.
(3) redirect or final URL behavior, which shows how the site handles traffic and may expose additional endpoints.  
These help identify the target’s technology stack and configuration.  
As a defensive measure, administrators can minimize information leakage by removing or generalizing the Server header 
(e.g., using "Server: web" instead of "Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)") or by placing a reverse proxy that strips identifying headers.
